# Schedule It!

Schedule It is a daily events planner made to enhance your time management skills during work hours. Enter tasks, meetings, 
and or events into each hour-block to keep track of your responsibilities throughout the day.

## How it Works

* When you open your daily planner you'll be presented with the current date at the top of the calendar, and time-blocks for each hour of the workday below.
* Each time-block will be colour-coded. Green means the time-block is in the future, grey means the time-block is in the past, and red means 
the time-block is the current hour of the day. 

## How to Use

### Add an Event and Save It
Click on the second column of a time-block row and be presented with a text area in which you can enter an event. Once you enter the event you can save it by clicking the save icon in the third column of the time-block row. Clicking the save button will ensure 
that the event entered will persist upon refreshing the page and/or closing and re-opening the page at a later time.

### Edit Events
* The events entered can also be edited and/or erased at anytime by clicking the text-area and making any needed changes. Just make sure to click 
the corresponding save button again so that edits can persist upon refresh.

### Delete All Events
* When the workday is done you are also able to clear all entered events with one click by clicking the "Delete All Tasks" button at the bottom of the 
screen. This will quickly and efficiently clear your schedule for the next day.
